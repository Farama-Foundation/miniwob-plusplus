# MiniWoB++

The MiniWoB++ library contains a collection of over 100 **web interaction environments**,
along with JavaScript and Python interfaces for programmatically interacting with them.
The Python interface follows the [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) API
and uses [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/)
to perform actions on the web browser. 

MiniWoB++ is an extension of the
[OpenAI MiniWoB benchmark](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/shi17a/shi17a.pdf),
and was introduced in the paper
[Reinforcement Learning on Web Interfaces using Workflow-Guided
Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08802).

The Gymnasium interface allows an agent to initialize and interact with a MiniWoB++ environment as follows:
```python
import gymnasium
env = gymnasium.make('miniwob/click-test-2-v1', render_mode='human')
try:
  observation, info = env.reset(seed=42)
  for _ in range(1000):
    action = policy(observation)  # User-defined policy function
    observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action) 
    if terminated:
      observation, info = env.reset()
finally:
  env.close()
```
