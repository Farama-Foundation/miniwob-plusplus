# MiniWoB++

The MiniWoB++ benchmark is an extension of the
[OpenAI MiniWoB benchmark](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/shi17a/shi17a.pdf).
It adds a number of tasks, Javascript interfaces, as well as Python code for
interacting with the environment via Selenium. The benchmark was introduced in
the paper:
[Reinforcement Learning on Web Interfaces using Workflow-Guided
Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08802).

## Usage

The Gymnasium interface allows to initialize and interact with the MiniWoB++
default environments as follows:
