### Question

If you're a beginner and have basic questions, please ask on [r/reinforcementlearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/) or in the [RL Discord](https://discord.com/invite/xhfNqQv) (if you're new please use the beginners channel). Basic questions that are not bugs or feature requests will be closed without reply, because GitHub issues are not an appropriate venue for these.

Advanced/nontrivial questions, especially in areas where documentation is lacking, are very much welcome.
