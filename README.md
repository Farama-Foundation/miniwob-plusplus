# MiniWoB++

The MiniWoB++ benchmark is an extension of the [OpenAI MiniWoB benchmark](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/shi17a/shi17a.pdf).
It adds a number of tasks, Javascript interfaces, as well as
Python code for interacting with the environment via Selenium.

[The list of tasks can be viewed here](https://farama-foundation.github.io/miniwob-plusplus/)

The MiniWoB++ benchmark is introduced in our paper:

> **Reinforcement Learning on Web Interfaces using Workflow-Guided Exploration.**  
> _Evan Zheran Liu\*, Kelvin Guu\*, Panupong Pasupat\*, Tianlin Shi, Percy Liang_  
> ICLR, 2018.

Development on MiniWoB++ is currently ongoing to bring it up to our standards for mature projects (https://farama.org/project_standards.html) and will be maintained long term after this point. If you'd like to help out, you can join our discord server here- https://discord.gg/PfR7a79FpQ
