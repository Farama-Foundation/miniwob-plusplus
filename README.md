The MiniWoB++ (Mini World of Bits++) library contains a collection of over 100 **web interaction environments**,
along with JavaScript and Python interfaces for programmatically interacting with them.
The Python interface follows the [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) API
and uses [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/)
to perform actions on the web browser. 

MiniWoB++ is an extension of the
[OpenAI MiniWoB benchmark](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/shi17a/shi17a.pdf),
and was introduced in the paper
[Reinforcement Learning on Web Interfaces using Workflow-Guided
Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08802).

Development on MiniWoB++ is currently ongoing to bring it up to [our standards](https://farama.org/project_standards.html) for mature projects, and will be maintained long term after this point. If you'd like to help out, you can join our discord server here: <https://discord.gg/PfR7a79FpQ>.
